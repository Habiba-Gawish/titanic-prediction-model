This project explores the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training.

This project is based on the Titanic dataset and walks through:

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Model building with Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
-Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, AUC, confusion matrix, and cross-validation
-Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

| Question | Description                                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Q1       | How many passengers survived and how many didnâ€™t? *(Bar chart)*                  |
| Q2       | What percentage of males vs females survived? *(Pie or count plot)*              |
| Q3       | Compare survival rate across passenger classes (Pclass).                         |
| Q4       | Plot age distribution. Compare average age of survivors vs non-survivors.        |
| Q5       | Analyze survival rate of passengers with family aboard (SibSp or Parch > 0).     |
| Q6       | Survival rate of passengers who paid more than average fare.                     |
| Q7       | Create "Child", "Adult", and "Senior" age categories. Which group survived most? |
| Q8       | Check for missing values. How were they handled?                                 |
| Q9       | Heatmap of correlations between numerical features. Insights?                    |
| Q10      | Survival counts by Embarked location. Which had the highest rate?                |
| Q11      | Train a Decision Tree model. Accuracy? Overfitting?                 |
| Q12      | Train a Random Forest. Is performance improved?                     |
| Q13      | Train an XGBoost model. Compare performance.                        |
| Q14      | Plot ROC curve & AUC score for each model.                          |
| Q15      | 5-Fold cross-validation. Mean accuracy & std. Which is most stable? |
| Q16      | Confusion matrix of the best model. Interpret it.                   |
| Q17      | Tune Random Forest with GridSearchCV. Best params and accuracy?     |
| Q18      | Tune XGBoost with GridSearchCV. Best params and performance?        |
| Q19      | Which model would you choose & why? (Based on metrics & stability)  |
